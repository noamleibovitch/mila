/// observe `canCheckForUpdates` and disable themselves while a check is
/// already in flight. Created once at app launch — Sparkle starts its
/// scheduled background poll immediately (interval comes from
/// `SUScheduledCheckInterval` in Info.plist).
///
/// It ALSO drives the custom pre-update "What's New" popup. When Sparkle's
/// scheduled background poll finds a newer valid version, we intercept it
/// via the gentle-reminder delegate hooks: `availableUpdate` is published so
/// `ContentView` can present `WhatsNewPopup` instead of Sparkle's stock
/// "update available" window. "Update Now" calls back into Sparkle's normal
/// install flow; "Later" dismisses. A USER-initiated "Check for Updates…"
/// (from the app menu) always uses Sparkle's standard UI — we only swap in
/// the custom popup for the silent scheduled discovery, which is where the
/// enticement matters.
///
/// Content for the popup comes from the appcast item's release notes
/// (`SUAppcastItem.itemDescription`): the installed app can't carry a
/// not-yet-released version's local notes, so "populate every new version"
/// means writing per-release highlights into each appcast `<description>`.

    ///      the whole finalize, so a second Start was blocked until the tail
    ///      finished.

    ///      (rediarize / SRT / summarize / transcode, or batch enqueue) is
    ///      still settling in the background, and BOTH recordings end up in
    ///      the store with their live transcripts intact (neither clobbers
    ///      the other — the id-keyed `finalizeTasks` ownership model).
