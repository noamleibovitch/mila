// MARK: - Logging privacy in this file
//
// Every line the transcription pass emits used to be a `print`, and a `print`
// is public by construction — it has no privacy annotation, and an app
// launched by launchd has its stdio captured into the unified log regardless.
// The pass is also the highest-volume producer of these lines: one set per
// recording, forever.
//
// `recording.title` is a meeting name — "Q3 board call", a client, a
// candidate's name — and it was interpolated into roughly fourteen of them.
// So the rule here, the one PR #183 settled for `RecordingStore`:
//
//   * the recording's UUID is the PUBLIC correlation key. It carries no
//     content, and it is what lets you follow one recording across the queue,
//     the run and the failure.
//   * the title, and any filename derived from it, are `.private`. Audio,
//     transcript, summary and subtitle names all come from the title via
//     `RecordingStore.freshAudioURL(suggestedName:)` / `FileTranscriber`'s
//     `safeStem`, so logging a filename logs a title.
//   * an `error`'s message is `.private` wherever the failure touched one of
//     those files, because Cocoa quotes the offending file — and its
//     containing folder — inside `localizedDescription`. `NSError.domain` and
//     `code` stay public: they are what separates "no permission" from a full
//     disk, and they name nothing.
//   * everything that is model/engine/queue state — model names, sample
//     counts, segment counts, speaker counts, durations — stays `.public`.
//     Redacting those would make a real failure undiagnosable and protect
//     nothing.
//
// (Issue #213, CWE-532.)

    ///   pass re-keys every `SPEAKER_NN` and names assigned against the old IDs
    ///   would then label the wrong voice. A failed/rejected pass must leave it
    ///   alone.
    /// * **User-owned** — never written here; the live row always wins:
    ///   `title`, `folder`, `deletedAt`, `summary`, `actionItems`.
    /// * **Store-owned** — identity and provenance, also never written here:
    ///   `id`, `createdAt`, `source`, `audioFileName`, `appName`,
    ///   `voiceMemoUniqueID`, `voiceMemoFolderUUID`. (`audioFileName` in
    ///   particular: the post-completion compression renames the file, and
    ///   restoring the snapshot's name would point the row at a deleted `.wav`.)
    /// * `language` is deliberately **not** pass-owned. The pass only *reads*
    ///   it; `RecordingStore.prepareForRetranscription` is the writer, so an
    ///   in-flight language switch must not be rolled back by an older pass.
    ///
    /// **Deleted rows.** Returns `nil` — writing nothing — when the recording
    /// is gone from the store entirely: hard-deleted from the sidebar, or
    /// swept by Empty Trash. We never re-`add` it; resurrecting a row the user
