    /// **Why 3, and why it has not moved.** The arithmetic pins the ends, not
    /// the interior, and both ends are real failures:
    ///
    ///   * **n₀ = 0 is provably wrong.** `(0·c₀ + e)/1 == e` — the stored
    ///     voice would be discarded by its own first match, so seeding would
    ///     affect the first comparison of a recording and nothing after it.
    ///   * **No cap is wrong too.** A mature profile sits at
    ///     `VoiceProfile.maxSampleCount`, so within-recording adaptation
    ///     becomes arithmetically impossible. A returning speaker whose
    ///     acoustics genuinely changed (new headset, different room, a cold)
    ///     then never clears `similarityThreshold`, never gets a confident
    ///     match, so `observedCount` stays 0 and
    ///     `RecognisedSpeakerAssigner.finish` correctly refuses to auto-name
    ///     them — meaning **nothing is learned and the profile can never
    ///     adapt in a future recording either.** The profile that most needs
    ///     updating becomes the one that cannot be updated.
    ///
    /// Between those ends the failures are asymmetric, and that asymmetry —
    /// not a measurement — is what keeps n₀ small. A too-light anchor lets
    /// one noisy or false-positive match half-steal the entry, but the damage
    /// is confined to a single recording. A too-heavy anchor's damage
    /// persists across every future recording, per the bullet above. It also
    /// runs the opposite way to intuition: a heavier anchor keeps the entry
    /// further from today's acoustics, so a returning speaker's *later*
    /// utterances are more likely to fall below `createThreshold` and mint a
    /// duplicate `SPEAKER_NN` — a stronger anchor can *increase*
    /// over-segmentation.
    ///
    /// What the asymmetry does **not** do is choose between 2, 3 and 4. Every
    /// n₀ ≥ 1 is well-formed — the divisor is never zero and the fold is
    /// always a proper convex combination — so there is no degenerate value
    /// in that range and no discontinuity at the cap boundary. Picking among
