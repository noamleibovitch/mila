/// to a long-running Python daemon that computes a pyannote/wespeaker
/// embedding per chunk. Swift maintains a pool of speaker centroids and
/// assigns stable `SPEAKER_00`, `SPEAKER_01`, … labels via cosine similarity.
///
/// The daemon model:
///   * loads the bundled pyannote Pipeline once at startup (~3–5 s cold
///     start — far cheaper than spawning a fresh subprocess every tick),
///   * extracts the embedding `Inference` object (`pipeline._embedding`)
///     and skips the heavy segmentation/clustering pass,

///     (`{"cmd":"embed","wav":"/tmp/…"}`), writes one JSON line per
///     response on stdout (`{"embedding":[…256 floats…]}` or
///     `{"error":"…"}`).
///
/// If the daemon fails to start (no Python, no models, dependency missing)
/// we publish `lastError` and `intervals` stays empty — the live UI just
/// shows unlabeled text. This is the documented `isConfigured` invariant
/// from `.claude/rules/feature-gates.md`: optional features must degrade
