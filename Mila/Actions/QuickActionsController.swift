        // singletons (`liveTranscriber` / `liveDiarizer` / `liveAISession`),

        //
        //   1. Bugbot Finding #1: those singletons get reset on the NEXT
        //      recording's `start()` (epoch bump, `aiSession.start()`,
        //      `diarizer.reset()`). A background task reading them after a
        //      new recording started would snapshot the NEW recording's
        //      state and apply it to the OLD recording's id. The
        //      `isFinalizingRecording` re-entry guard in `toggleRecord` /
        //      `startRecording` is what holds a new recording off until
        //      this drain + the live-singleton teardown below complete.
        //
        //   2. Bugbot Finding #3: `wireLiveAIPipeline`'s `.idle`
        //      handler also drains the same pipelines. Without
        //      explicit coordination the two paths interleave —
        //      `.idle` can call `transcriber.stop()` while we're
        //      still reading state, wiping segments out from under
        //      the snapshot.
        //
        // The HEAVY tail that follows the snapshot (offline re-diarize /
        // summarize / transcode / batch enqueue) touches none of those
        // singletons, so it's split off into a background `finalizeTasks`
        // entry (`finalizeTail`) and the record button frees up before it
        // runs — letting the user start a new recording immediately.
        //
        // The sheet still appears immediately: `postRecording.present`
