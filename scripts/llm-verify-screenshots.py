"""
Visual regression check using Claude's vision API.

Reads PNGs from `--dir` (default `/tmp/mila-ui-screenshots/` — the
location Mila's UI tests write to), sends each to Claude with a
focused prompt about Mila's expected layout, and fails if the model
reports a layout regression.

What the LLM is told to look for
--------------------------------
For HOME shots (filename contains "home" or "launch"):
  * Left sidebar list visible with rows: Home, Queue, More, Folders,
    All Transcriptions, Trash, Settings.
  * Main pane shows a "Mila / by Island" wordmark and a Record button.
  * No visibly-empty main pane.

For DETAIL shots (filename contains "detail"):
  * Sidebar list still visible (same rows as above).
  * Main pane shows the recording's title at the TOP, a transcript
    or progress indicator in the middle, and a playback bar at the
    bottom.
  * Nothing collapsed / nothing pushed off-screen.

For LIST shots (filename contains "transcriptions" or "list"):
  * Sidebar list visible.
  * Main pane shows a list header + at least one recording row.

For SETTINGS shots (filename contains "settings"):
  * Left sidebar lists the nine section rows (General … Storage), one
    selected.
  * Right pane shows that section's real controls, not a blank card.
  * No tab strip and no ">>" overflow chevron.

The script exits non-zero if Claude reports ANY of: sidebar items
missing, main pane visibly empty, content overflowing or cut off,
extreme misalignment that suggests a layout bug.
